# QuikQ
QuikQ was inspired by the need to collaborate with friends on a Spotify queue during a dinner party. Even when all of the music is controlled via one personâ€™s device, the idea of QuikQ would allow anyone in the room to partake. This obviously translates to any group setting including dinners, parties, and hackathons.
